# Weirding Module Setup - Progress Report

## ðŸŽ‰ Completed Components

### 1. âœ… Python Virtual Environment Setup
- Created and configured Python virtual environment (`venv/`)
- Installed all required dependencies: `typer`, `rich`, `questionary`
- Environment is properly isolated and ready for development

### 2. âœ… Drive Detection System (`modules/device_setup.py`)
**Key Features Implemented:**
- **DriveInfo Class**: Comprehensive data structure for drive information
- **DriveDetector Class**: Advanced drive scanning and analysis
- **Hardware Detection**: Identifies connection types (USB, SATA, NVMe, etc.)
- **Size Parsing**: Converts human-readable sizes to bytes and vice versa

- **Requirements Checking**: Validates drives meet minimum specs (32GB+)
- **Usage Analysis**: Calculates used/free space and partition information
- **Safety Warnings**: Identifies potential data loss scenarios

**Successfully Detects:**
- Samsung PSSD T7 Shield (1.8TB USB drive) âœ… Suitable
- Generic USB devices (filtered out if too small)
- Internal NVMe drives (correctly identified as unsuitable)

### 3. âœ… Interactive User Interface (`modules/interactive_ui.py`)
**Rich Interactive Experience:**
- **Welcome Screen**: Project overview with safety warnings
- **Drive Scanning**: Real-time progress indicators
- **Drive Selection**: Beautiful table display with status indicators

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display system
- **Success Messaging**: Completion summaries and next steps

### 4. âœ… Command Line Interface (`main.py`)
**Available Commands:**
- `python main.py setup-module` - Interactive Weirding Module setup
- `python main.py list-drives` - List all detected drives with suitability
- `python main.py setup-host` - Host system preparation (placeholder)
- `python main.py version` - Version information

**Safety Features:**
- Root privilege checking for disk operations
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Graceful cancellation at any step

### 5. âœ… Safety and Validation Systems
**Multi-Layer Safety:**
- Drive requirement validation (size, external status)
- Data loss warnings with detailed impact analysis
- Multiple confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Drive path verification for critical operations
- Mount status checking and warnings
