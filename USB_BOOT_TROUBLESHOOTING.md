# USB Boot Troubleshooting Guide

## When Your Weirding Module USB Drive Won't Boot

If your BIOS doesn't detect the bootable USB drive or it fails to boot, follow this systematic troubleshooting guide.

## üîç Step 1: Verify USB Drive Creation

First, confirm the USB drive was created successfully:

```bash
# Check if the drive has bootable signatures
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdX  # Replace X with your drive letter

# Look for:
# - Bootable flag (*) 
# - Boot partition type
# - Correct size matching your ISO
```

Expected output should show something like:
```
Device     Boot Start    End Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdc1  *     2048 123456  121408 59.3M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: BIOS/UEFI Settings Configuration

### Accessing BIOS/UEFI Setup
- **During boot**: Press F2, F12, DEL, or ESC (varies by manufacturer)
- **Common keys by brand**:
  - Dell: F2 or F12
  - HP: F10 or F12  
  - Lenovo: F1 or F12
  - ASUS: F2 or DEL
  - MSI: DEL or F2

### Critical Settings to Check

#### 1. Boot Mode Settings
```
Setting: Boot Mode / Boot List Option
Options: UEFI | Legacy | Both
Recommended: Try UEFI first, then Legacy if it fails
```

#### 2. Secure Boot (UEFI Systems)
```
Setting: Secure Boot Control
Current: Enabled
Change to: Disabled
Note: This is often the main culprit for USB boot failures
```

#### 3. Fast Boot / Quick Boot
```
Setting: Fast Boot
Current: Enabled  
Change to: Disabled
Reason: Skips USB detection during quick startup
```

#### 4. USB Support
```
Setting: USB Configuration / USB Support
Ensure enabled:
- USB Controller
- USB 2.0 Controller  
- USB 3.0/3.1 Controller
- Legacy USB Support
```

#### 5. CSM (Compatibility Support Module)
```
Setting: CSM Support
For Legacy boot: Enabled
For UEFI boot: Disabled
For Hybrid ISOs: Enabled (try both modes)
```

#### 6. Boot Priority/Order
```
Setting: Boot Priority / Boot Order
Action: Move USB device to top of list
Look for: USB HDD, USB-FDD, Removable Devices
```

## üîß Step 3: Hardware Troubleshooting

### USB Port Testing
1. **Try different USB ports**:
   - Use USB 2.0 ports (more compatible)
   - Avoid USB 3.0+ ports initially
   - Try rear ports on desktops (more reliable)

2. **USB drive compatibility**:
   - Some older BIOS don't support USB 3.0 drives
   - Try a different USB drive if available
   - USB 2.0 drives often have better compatibility

### üöÄ USB 4.0 Specific Issues & Solutions

**USB 4.0 drives often have boot compatibility problems** because:
- Most BIOS predate USB 4.0 standard (2019+)
- USB 4.0 requires specific controller drivers not available during boot
- Higher speed protocols may not fall back to legacy modes properly

#### USB 4.0 Workaround Methods:

1. **Force USB 2.0/3.0 Compatibility Mode**:
   ```bash
   # Create USB with explicit USB 2.0 parameters
   sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress conv=fsync
   
   # Alternative: Use smaller block size for better compatibility
   sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=512k status=progress conv=fsync oflag=sync
   ```

2. **BIOS Settings for USB 4.0**:
   - **Enable "USB Legacy Support"** (critical)
   - **Set "USB Mode" to "Auto" or "Compatible"** (not "USB 4.0 Only")
   - **Enable "xHCI Hand-off"** if available
   - **Disable "USB Fast Charge"** (can interfere with boot detection)

3. **Physical Connection Solutions**:
   - **Use USB-C to USB-A adapter** (forces slower protocol)
   - **Try different USB-C ports** (some may have USB 3.0 fallback)
   - **Use USB 3.0/2.0 hub** as intermediary device
   - **Connect to laptop/desktop USB 3.0 port** instead of USB-C 4.0

4. **USB 4.0 Drive Compatibility Mode**:
   Many USB 4.0 drives have built-in compatibility:
   ```bash
   # Check if your drive supports compatibility mode
   lsusb -v | grep -A 5 -B 5 "your_drive_name"
   
   # Look for multiple speed capabilities:
   # - SuperSpeed (USB 3.0)
   # - High-speed (USB 2.0)
   # - Full-speed (USB 1.1)
   ```

#### USB 4.0 Creation Parameters:
For USB 4.0 drives, use these optimized parameters:

```bash
# Method 1: Conservative approach (most compatible)
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress conv=fsync oflag=direct

# Method 2: If Method 1 fails, try without direct I/O
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=512k status=progress conv=fsync

# Method 3: Force sync after each block (slowest but most reliable)
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress conv=sync
```

#### Hardware-Specific USB 4.0 Solutions:

**Thunderbolt 4/USB 4.0 Hubs:**
- Connect USB 4.0 drive through USB 3.0 hub
- Hub will force compatibility mode automatically

**USB-C Dock/Adapter Method:**
```bash
# If using USB-C dock with USB-A ports:
# 1. Connect USB 4.0 drive to dock's USB-A port
# 2. This forces USB 3.0 compatibility mode
# 3. Create bootable USB normally
```

**Laptop-Specific Settings:**
- **Dell XPS/Precision**: Look for "USB PowerShare" - disable it
- **MacBook Pro**: Use right-side USB-C ports (often have better compatibility)
- **ThinkPad**: Enable "Always On USB" in BIOS power settings

### BIOS Age Considerations
- **Very old BIOS** (pre-2010): May not support USB booting at all
- **Old BIOS** (2010-2015): May need Legacy mode and specific USB formats
- **Modern BIOS** (2015+): Should support both UEFI and Legacy

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Advanced Troubleshooting

### Re-create USB with Different Parameters

If the standard creation failed, try these alternatives:

```bash
# Method 1: Use different block size
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress conv=fdatasync

# Method 2: Add sync and verify
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
sudo sync

# Method 3: Use specialized tools
# Install ventoy for universal USB booting
sudo apt install ventoy
sudo ventoy -i /dev/sdX
```

### Check ISO Compatibility
Some ISOs work better than others:

1. **Ubuntu Desktop ISO**: Usually most compatible (hybrid ISO)
2. **Ubuntu Server ISO**: May need different boot parameters  
3. **Custom ISOs**: May lack proper boot signatures

### Hybrid ISO Creation
If your ISO isn't hybrid (doesn't work on both UEFI and Legacy):

```bash
# Make ISO hybrid with isohybrid (if available)
sudo apt install syslinux-utils
sudo isohybrid ubuntu.iso

# Then re-write to USB
sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

## üìã Step 5: Boot Menu Testing

### Access Boot Menu
Instead of changing BIOS settings permanently:
1. **Boot menu keys** (during startup):
   - F8, F10, F11, F12 (varies by manufacturer)
2. **Select USB device** from one-time boot menu
3. **Look for entries like**:
   - USB HDD: Your Drive Name
   - UEFI: Your Drive Name  
   - Legacy: Your Drive Name

### Boot Entry Names to Look For
- "USB HDD"
- "Removable Devices"
- "UEFI: [Your USB Drive Name]"
- "Generic USB Device"
- Your actual USB drive model name

## üî¨ Step 6: Diagnostic Commands

### Verify USB Drive Status
```bash
# Check drive recognition
lsblk
lsusb
sudo dmesg | tail -20

# Check partition table
sudo parted /dev/sdX print

# Check bootable flags
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdX | grep -E "(Boot|System)"

# Test read capability
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=1M count=100 status=progress
```

### Check ISO Bootability
```bash
# Verify ISO has boot signatures
file ubuntu.iso
hexdump -C ubuntu.iso | head -n 50

# Check for El Torito boot record
isoinfo -d -i ubuntu.iso | grep -i boot
```
